# Streamlit_model_visualization-\

This is a visualization website i made to test the hyperparameters of different models with a good visual view of data and decision boundary.
I will be adding some of the other models also in this repo, if you found it interesting you can just copy it and run it. But there is a process that need to be done in oreder to run it if you are new to python and Machine Learning.

Step 1 : First thing you should do is install streamlit with this in you command prompt(i don't know the command for linux and mac, just google it) - pip install streamlit.

Step 2 : After a succesful installation you should copy the code and paste it only in a .py file (any file than .py will not be able to run the program).

Step 3 : Then open your command prompt from the folder where you saved your file and write this code - streamlit run file_name.py  (replace file_name with the name you saved your file with ).

Well that was all from my side, As I'm still learning machine learning and all this, I am new as myself in this platform so if you have any suggestion for me please contact me through discussion
and you can check out some of my other work also, I have done some awesome project 

Thank you :)
